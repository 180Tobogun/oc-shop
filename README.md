# Octoshop - A Shop Plugin for October CMS

Pretty much does what it says on the tin. Octoshop adds all the basic functionality
needed to sell products from your website running on October CMS. Still in its infancy,
it's fairly barebones right now, though the process from browsing to buying is already
covered. Payments are powered by Stripe JS for now, letting me spend more time worrying
about the things that matter most.


## Demo

## Documentation

Not yet... Check out the demo, browse the source, and have a gander at the optional
[theme](https://github.com/dshoreman/octoshop-theme) if you want to play about.
